= What does it do? =
 * Compiles python into javascript, for execution in browsers, v8 etc.
   ** Pretty large subset of python is supported
   ** Couple of niggles (e.g. undefined gets in the way)
 * Compiles an AJAX Library (hybrid of javascript and python) into Javascript
 * Provides, for browser use, access to the browser DOM model
 * Takes away the pain of Web development.
   ** No more "browser incompatibilities"
   ** "CSS tricks" can be dealt with in a proper programming language
   ** Allows complex apps to be divided into classes and modules
 * Conceptually, Pyjamas takes getting used to
  ** No more disillusionment with dire AJAX awfulness
  ** No more "browser incompatibilities"
  ** No more CSS nastiness
