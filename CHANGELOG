                    Changes made to Pyjamas since 0.5p1
                    -----------------------------------

 * Extended string startswith, endswith, added ljust, rjust and center
   (thanks to Kees).

 * Added "pow", "hex", "oct", "round", "divmod", "all", "any" and "delattr".
   (thanks to Kees).

 * Added subscript support and more, from the llpamies branch (lkcl), to
   get pygtk working.

 * Added support for x ** y syntax (thanks to Kees).

 * Fixed getBoundingClientRect off-by-one bug (firefox 3 returns an
   inaccurate float, not an int)  thanks to khiraly

 * Added ToggleButton, PushButton and CustomButton (thanks to khiraly)

 * Added means to return and call functions from another function call
   (added by Kees)

 * Added means to derive classes from classes in other modules
   e.g. from module import parent; class child(parent): pass
   (thanks to Kees Bos).

 * Added class "Zero args" support (thanks to Kees Bos).
   TODO: support runtime exceptions when number of function
   call arguments is wrong, as illustrated in the new LibTest.

 * Added Multiple Inheritance (thanks to Kees Bos)

 * Add support for Google Gears (Database)

 * Completed DisclosurePanel port 


                    Changes made to Pyjamas since 0.5
                    ---------------------------------

 * Fixed Autocompletion which just needed non-modal on PopupPanel
   (thanks to lovelysystems for implementing non-modal dialogs
    otherwise it wouldn't be possible to fix Autocompletion)

 * Added implementation of metaclass "type" function

 * Made KeyboardListener a singleton module rather than have a class
   named the same as the module.  Likewise with MouseListener, Event
   and Focus.

 * Added Right-clickable Context Menus, and added an example in KitchenSink
   Menus.py to show how to set them up.

 * Added python-spidermonkey as an experimental platform, exactly like
   pyv8run.py now there is pysmrun.py

 * Top-level global variables, and top-level functions, now
   correctly scope in a module (thanks to Jose for raising this one)

 * String constants are now returned as instances of String()
   which results in them having the __iter__ method that has
   been added to the proto of the javascript base String type.

 * made TypeError inherit from BaseException rather than being a
   javascript proto from Error().  TypeError can now be raised
   as an Exception, with a message.

 * made == comparison use __eq__, which conditionally uses __cmp__
   if it is available: this fixes bugs in comparison of lists in the
   LibTest.  replaced a large number of numerical "==" comparisons
   with "is", so that __eq__ doesn't get called (efficiency).

 * added support for calling *args on functions: previously, a call
   function(*args) would result in the args being thrown away!

 * made Tuple its own class, rather than inheriting from List, in order
   that it can be distinguished from List.  __cmp__ of a List with a
   Tuple now correctly fails.

 * rewrote the examples/libtest so that they can be run under standard
   python (python ./LibTest.py).  this allows for a comparison of pyjs
   against standard python.

 * add method extend to pyjslib.List

 * add float to builtins

 * add pyjamas.log based on examples/libtest/write.py

 * registered builtin function 'cmp'. was already implemented but not
   registered in pyjs.py

 * added an --optimize option to which results in removing print
   statements. this could be further improved. e.g. when assert is
   implemented

 * fixed Mozilla "Permission Denied" bug in DOM.isOrHasChild

 * pyjslib.Dict now use the hash method to generate keys internally,
   so it si possible to use objects as keys like in python. For
   limitations on dicts read examples/libtest/DictTest.py

                    Changes made to Pyjamas since 0.4
                    ---------------------------------

 * convert app "loading" to require the use of "if __name__ == '__main__'"
   bringing pyjamas into line with "standard" python.  apps can convert with
   contrib/pyjamas_0.4-0.5_upgrade/add_name_main.py to add a small codefragment
   at the end: "app = MyApp(); app.onModuleLoad()"

 * added string iterator (for c in "hello")

 * added stacktrace recording and notification when -d option is given
   to builder.  expensive but useful.

 * added a helper tool (in contrib) called replacer.py which helps convert
   apps: "from pyjamas.ui import X,Y" is converted to
   "from pyjamas.ui.X import X; from pyjamas.ui.Y import Y"

 * split ui.py into separate modules.  cache file sizes are now drastically
   reduced due to importing only including what is needed.  the reduction
   is possible with both dynamic and static code-generation, although not
   as much for static.

 * dynamic module loading is now possible (add -m 1 to build).  each module
   is placed in its own separate cache file, with platform overrides
   also getting their own cache file.  cache files are shared between
   platforms rather than four separate identical compiled modules being
   created.  none of this optimisation is possible without dynamic loading

 * added "reverse" method of List. Thanks to Soulburner

 * The user.agent value for Mozilla is no longer "moz", instead
   "mozilla" is returned, to be consistent with platform names.

 * .cache.html files are now generated with their md5 hash in the name
   like in gwt. This now allows to cache those files on the
   browser.  add -c or --cache-buster to builder command-line to enable.

 * all none-native functions always return None now, which matches the
   behaviour of python.

 * implemented "lambda". note that lambdas are only supported without
   kwargs or varargs

 * "while" and "if" statements now use the new "bool" function to
   evaluate their expressions. Now it is possible to do things like
   "if ([])".

 * implemented builtin "bool" function, also the "is" and "is not"
   operators are now generating "===" and "!==", this is needed to
   distinct between undefined and null.

 * added CaptionPanel (see showcase)

 * the pyjs compiler now uses the pyjs.path variable using the same
   semantics as sys.path in python to find python module files to be
   compiled to javascript. the path can also be set via the
   environment variable PYJSPATH

 * Changed development setup to generate ./bin/pyjscompile ./bin/pyjsbuild

 * implemented "isdigit" for strings

 * added support for unicode constants, the encoding is now explicitly
   set in the *.cache.html files to "utf-8". Strings should now be
   encoded in a safer manner.

 * implemented basic Exceptions in pyjslib and added them to the global
   namespace.

 * implemented try except statements with an expression. Raising and
   catching of class based Exceptions is now possible. String based
   Exceptions also work.

 * implemented the 'isinstance' builtin function, currently only
   works on normal class instances.

 * implemented the 'raise' statement. it only works with a single expression.

 * changed 'getattr' to accept a default and raise an AttributeError
   if the attribute cannot be found.

 * implemented 'setattr'

 * added none modal behaviour to DialogBox

 * fixed bug if mouse is moved too fast while dragging a dialog

 * added support for statements at the "global" level in pyjs.py, so
   that compiling "if __name__ == '__main__': " and other such global
   code statements will now work.

                    Changes made to Pyjamas since 0.3
                    ---------------------------------

Enhancements

 * Added library/splitpanel.py and library/vertsplitpanel.py, along with
  examples/splitpanel.  NOTE: splitpanels should be in ui.

 * Changed ui.TabBar.insertTab() to allow widgets to be passed as well as text.

 * Added examples/tabpanelwidget

 * Added gtk_converter to the "contrib" directory (thanks to Jeremy)

 * Added library/decoratorpanel.py which includes DecoratorPanel,
   DecoratedTabPanel and DecoratedTabBar.  NOTE: these classes should
   be in ui.

 * Added examples/slideshow

 * Added support for slicing with negative numbers.

 * Added examples/jsobject

 * Added support for a debugging mode, which can be turned on by include a "-d"
  command-line option when calling build.py.  With this option turned on, each
  statement in your Python code is surrounded by a try...except statement that
  displays an alert if an exception occurs.  The alert message contains the
  original Python source text, the line number in your Python source file
  where the error occurred, and the details of the Javscript error which
  occurred.  This should greatly simplify debugging your Pyjamas code.

 * Issue #75: Added support for "is not None" syntax.

 * Issue #85: Implemented the repr() built-in function.

 * Issue #93: Implemented dict.items().

 * Issue #95: Implemented Window.prompt().

 * Issue #100: Added a setPadding() method to ui.CellPanel.

 * Issue #103: Implemented the enumerate() built-in function.

 * Issue #104: Added the ability to assign to a list of variables, for example:
  x,y = self.method()

 * Issue #105: Implemented the min() and max() built-in functions.

 * Issue #88: It is now possible to use the getattr() built-in function to
  obtain a method, and then pass parameters to that method when you call it.
  There is a new example in the "examples/" directory, called "getattr", which
  demonstrates how this can be used.

 * Issue #111: Added XOR and bit-shift operators, thanks to legith.

 * Issue #112: Added support for the ord() and chr() built-in functions
  (thanks, legith!).

 * Issue #113: Implemented support for basic try...except statements.  There is
  also a new module, examples/libtest/ExceptionTest.py, which tests the use of
  the try...except statement.


Bug Fixes, etc.

 * Added a new implementation of sprintf.

 * Issue #86: Fixed a bug which could cause HTTPRequest to crash.  Thanks to
  finder83 from code.google.com/p/pyjamas for helping to find this.

 * Added standard images to use for the edges and corners of a dialog box

 * Various changes to ui.py and DOM.py to (partially) support event handling on
  dialog boxes.

 * Fixed a bug in ui.CellFormatter.getElement() which could cause a crash.

 * Fixed a problem with ui.FormSubmitEvent.setCancelled()

 * Fixed bug in ui.clickDelegatePanel.onBrowserEvent() which caused a crash
  when processing a keyDown event.

 * Changed ui.ClickDelegatePanel.onBrowserEvent() to check that the key
  delegate actually has an "onKeyDown" method before attempting to call it.

 * Issue #54: Fixed a probem with browser detection (via the "user-agent"
  string) under Internet Explorer 7.0.  Apparently Microsoft decided to change
  the user-agent string in IE 7, breaking the code in Pyjamas which identified
  the user's browser.

 * Removed code from DOM.init() which was attempting to fix a bug with
  capturing elements, but didn't work.

 * Fixed a bug in ComplexPanel.insert which was causing Internet Explorer 6 to
  corrupt its DOM model.

 * Issue #53: Fixed a problem with operator precedence.

 * Issue #91: Added DOM.eventGetCurrentEvent() function to retrieve the current
  event.

 * Changed FocusWidget.onBrowserEvent() to check that the click listener
  actually has an "onClick" method before attempting to call it.

 * Issue #82: Changed content-type sent by library/HTTPRequest.asyncPostImpl to
  "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" rather than "text/plain".  This allows
  the HTTPRequest object to be used to make AJAX calls using HTTP POST
  requests.

 * Issue #81: Fixed library/ui.Panel.clear().

 * Added a cascading stylesheet to the examples/mail program

 * Issue #106: Fixed a problem where using a tuple as a dictionary key produced
  unexpected results

 * Issue #107: It is now possible to include a plus sign at the start of a
  numeric literal

 * Moved datetime.py from the addons directory into library.

 * Issue #80: Changed many of the examples to use the new "pyjamas" package
  name.

 * Fixed a problem with using negative slices on lists (thanks, Legith).
